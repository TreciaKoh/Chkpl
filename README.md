IS306- IDP Project SMU SIS G2T1
CheckPal is a prototyping project forour school module. It looks into using checklists as a form of aid in equipment checks and as a way to force checks to be done by instilling a form of ownership per check. 
It is created using NetBeans IDE 7.3 with Tomcat 7.0.4
As it is a prototype, the focus is not on being dynamic and as such we have employed use of jsp and javascripts, using session attributes and serialising inputs over url to perform our logic. The language used is Java.
